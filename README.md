# NSFW Resprite

This mod replaces most of the 2D artwork in the game with NSFW images.

This is my version of a NSFW mod for Hades 2. This is currently for The 1.0 release. There's still some work to do on it but I wanted to get a release that can be used on the 1.0 version quickly.

### Disclaimer:

This mod is made using AI image generation. Secifically Invoke AI using the following:
Model: perfectPonyXL_v40
LoRA: hades_pony_v2-1

## Features

- Replaces 40 character portraits for pretty much every female character in the game
- Replaces 17 portraits for the codex

## Install

- Install r2modman
- Enable the Show NSFW content in r2modman filter
- Install this mod and it's dependancies

## ToDo

1. Finalize all the portrait placements. I haven't run across all the images in-game yet and usually once I run across them in-game I need to adjust their placements to make them look appropriate.
2. I would love to add the effects that I needed to disable for all the portraits (glint, flames, blinking, moonglow, wiggle, etc.) but I don't know how to do that without a massive amount of work
3. Add additional artwork to replace the following images:
    `Portrait_Mel_EmpatheticFlushed_01`
    `Portrait_Mel_PleasedFlushed_01`
    `Portrait_Nemesis_Flushed_01`
    `Portrait_Hec_Bath_01` (The masked version)
    `Portrait_Hera_Displeased_01`
    `Portrait_Hestia_Displeased_01`
    `Portrait_Demeter_Pleased_01`
    `Portrait_Hestia_Default_01_Wrath`
    `Portrait_Eris_Flushed_01`
    `Portrait_Eris_Default_02`
    `Portrait_Eris_Flushed_02`
    `Portrait_Aphrodite_Displeased_01`
    The "inPerson" versions of portraits:
    `Portrait_Hera_InPerson_Displeased_01`
    `Portrait_Demeter_InPerson_01`
    `Portrait_Demeter_InPerson_Pleased_01`
    `Portrait_Selene_InPerson_01`
4. Finish replacing the following images:
    `Portraits_Hecate_Baby_01.png`
    `Portraits_Hecate_Frozen_01.png`
    `Portrait_Dora_Hardhat` (Hardhat, what?)
5. Replace Fates at some point?
6. Replace Scylla at some point?
